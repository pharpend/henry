<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<p>Henry was an anthropologist interested in preindustrial populations, the history of modern humans, and the evolution of human social life. His recent work is about genetic diversity within and between human populations. Some genetic markers, such as mitochondrial DNA, microsatellites, and quantitative traits, evolve rapidly enough to have information about size and isolation of subpopulations in the recent past. He has found evidence that our species had only a few thousand members during the last interglacial and that there were several subsequent demographic expansions, the earliest among the ancestors of contemporary sub-Saharan Africans. He has also done fieldwork with several groups in southern Africa, concentrating on family demographic histories. His particular interests have been the effects of infectious infertility on population structure, consequences of preferential treatment of children by sex for mortality and for growth and development, and the relationships among wealth, family organization, and individual reproductive outcomes.</p>


<h3>Obituary</h3>
<p>Dr. Henry Harpending,  Distinguished Professor and Thomas Professor of Anthropology at the University of Utah, died in Salt Lake City on April 3.  He also served as a member of the National Academy of Sciences and was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  
Henry received his undergraduate degree from Hamilton College in 1964 and his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1972.  His research focused on genetic diversity within and between human populations with over 120 publications in top outlets in his field.  He accumulated over three and a half years of field work in southern Africa conducting interviews of indigenous groups in the native !Kung language and collecting biological samples for genetic analysis.  His monograph <i>The Structure of an African Pastoralist Community: Demography, History and Ecology of the Ngamiland Herero</i> (with Renee Pennington), published by Oxford University Press, emphasizes the development of simple and appropriate models for testing ideas about how and why people today differ from their ancestors.  He also contributed to <i>The Aging Experience</i> (with Jennie Keith and colleagues), published by SAGE.  His book The 10,000 Year Explosion:  How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution (with Greg Cochran) has been translated into Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Portuguese.</p>

<p>Henry was a farm boy from rural Dundee, New York.  After graduating from Harvard, he spent a year at Yale University (1972-1973) before joining the faculty at the University of New Mexico (1973-1985).  He came to the University of Utah from The Pennsylvania State University in 1997.  At Penn State (1985-1997) he was the recipient of the Faculty Scholar Medal.</p>
